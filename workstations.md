# workstations

There should be workstations along the longest wall, not including the space where the server and some storage should be. This is roughly 5 meters, maybe 5.5 meters. I found a 2400mm format which extends to 4800mm in total length, which should do fine. Then we have some margin as well.

## material

We will need:

* two wide boards as table space, 600x2400x27mm, https://www.bauhaus.se/limfog-furu-27x600x2400mm (699 SEK)
* at least four boards (room for six?) for two (three) long shelves 4800mm across, 300x2400x27mm, https://www.bauhaus.se/limfog-furu-27x300x2400mm (379 SEK)
* six Elfa rails (three per section), https://www.bauhaus.se/vaggskena-elfa-1916mm-vit (97.50 SEK)
* six Elfa consoles for the wider boards, https://www.bauhaus.se/konsol-elfa-570mm-vit (88 SEK)
* at least twelve (or 18) Elfa consoles for the shelves, https://www.bauhaus.se/konsol-elfa-270mm-vit (25.50 SEK)
* screws for attaching the boards to the consoles, at least two screws per console
* fine sand paper
* wood oil, https://www.bauhaus.se/traolja-becker-elit-2-7-l (239 SEK)
* a pair of trestles, https://www.bauhaus.se/arbetsbock-stal-tra-max-100-kg  (300 SEK)

Cost with two shelves:

```
2 * 669 + 4 * 379 + 6 * 97.5 + 6 * 88 + 12 * 25.5 + 239 + 300 = 4812
```

Cost with three shelves:

```
2 * 669 + 6 * 379 + 6 * 97.5 + 6 * 88 + 18 * 25.5 + 239 + 300 = 5723
```

## preparation

I read on `byggmax.se` that you should put the boards in the room where they are to be installed for at least 48 hours before doing anything with them. Also remove all the wrapping before this.

We might also want to prepare the wider boards with wood oil. Use fine sand paper on the surface before applying it. Use plenty of oil and massage it into the wood using a soft sponge, leave it for 20 minutes and remove excess oil with a clean rag. Turn the board around and repeat the process on the other side. Repeat the treatment at least three times and use fine sand paper in between.

Total area for all boards is (both sides)

```
4.8 * (0.6 * 2 + 0.3 * 2 * 2) ~ 11.5 m2
```

## maintenance

Apply more oil on the wide boards every 2-3 months or when you feel it's needed.
